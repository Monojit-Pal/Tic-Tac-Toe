# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is a C-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where the player competes against the computer on a 3x3 board. It offers two difficulty modes: standard and "God" mode, with the latter being nearly unbeatable. The game tracks player wins, computer wins, and draws, with dynamic computer moves and an interactive player experience.
